# Reasons
I made this little code when cryptocurrencies started to be a boom, initially I bought Doge coins for the memes, but I realized that this world of cryptocurrencies is not for me. At that time I really wanted to see in real time how much money I was making or losing, so this is the reason why I made this little "script / website" to track in real time the sales and purchases that were made on Binance through your public websocket
